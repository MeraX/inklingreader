InklingReader
==============

This project is an attempt to create a GNU/Linux-friendly version of the Wacom 
Inkling SketchManager. Instead of integrating with proprietary programs, this
program aims to be compatible with free software alternatives like Inkscape.

Currently the program can convert a WPI file into an Inkscape SVG file.


Dependencies
------------

Make sure you have the following libraries, development packages and build 
tools installed:

* GCC

* Gtk+-3.0, GLib-2.0 and Cairo
