InklingReader
==============

This project is an attempt to create a GNU/Linux-friendly version of the Wacom 
Inkling SketchManager. Instead of integrating with proprietary programs, this
program aims to be compatible with free software alternatives like Inkscape.

The program can:
* Display WPI files
* Export to Inkscape SVG (preserving layers), PDF and PNG
* Automatically use different colors when the "new layer" is pressed multiple times.


Dependencies
------------

Make sure you have the following libraries, development packages and build 
tools installed:

* GCC
* Make
* Gtk+-3.0, GLib-2.0 and Cairo
* Librsvg-2.0
